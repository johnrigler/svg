Ready for the laser. I will ignore the blue polygon when I convert this to a toolpath.  At first glance, this might be simple, but the green lines which I want cut take a great deal of thought in order to be perfectly placed. I still have quite a bit of work to go into order to separate my data from code, but at least now I have a workable image.

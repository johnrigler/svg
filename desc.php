I have my data moved over to a yaml file!  The next step is to figure out how to predict which way each line should be moved.  The polygon has a sense of 'insideness' which I am trying to understand.  For each of the teeth or puzzle piece sections, the cutting head must move in a certain direction.  I guess the start is to realize that I should be able to reduce my options from 4 choices to 2.  The arrows, and thus the move, always goes away from the center.

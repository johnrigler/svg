Adding functionality to Point to define corners in Polygon.

<hr>

My points are all hard-coded, but at least I have my offsites going in the right direction.
Ready for the laser. I will ignore the blue polygon when I convert this to a toolpath.  At first glance, this might be simple, but the green lines which I want cut take a great deal of thought in order to be perfectly placed. I still have quite a bit of work to go into order to separate my data from code, but at least now I have a workable image.

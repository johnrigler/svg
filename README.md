Copyright (C) 2016 Secret Beach Solutions, LLC

##1 INTRODUCTION

The SVG Generator is an open source production tool.  The SVG can be converted into a CNC control file. 

## 2 LICENSING

This software is released under the Apache 2.0 license, a copy of which is located in the LICENSE file.  

##3 BUILDING

To use this solution, follow the steps shown below to obtain the source. Apache and PHP are required.

       git clone https://github.com/johnrigler/svg

##4 DOWNLOADS

This is currently an all in one solution, everything you need is in index.php.  But you are on your own loading it into a cutter.

##5 DOCUMENTATION

This is it.

##6 INSTALLATION

Make sure to clone to a directory accessible from the web.  This isn't converted into a library yet.

##7 DEVELOPMENT

This is developed on a Ubuntu server.  I ssh over and just run vim.  I also have a meta refresh tag in the code, so I can do the bulk of my
work in one screen and just watch the browser refresh with my changes, I know within seconds if I have broken something.

##8 COMMUNITY

Anyone is welcome to call or email me.  In the past, Dallas Makerspace users have shown interest. I would suggest seeking out a group nearby with a laser cutter.  I would live to help you figure out how to use this, but my time is limited.  Professional enquiries are encouraged. 

##9 CONTRIBUTIONS

If you improve the base code, do load it back to github and let me know.

##10 PROBLEMS

This is open source software. I can support this for a fee.
